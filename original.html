    <div class="textForAll">Japanese horror influences horror cinema around the world — just look at all the (not always great) American remakes! Everyone knows Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) as the pillars of Japanese horror. For that reason (and because they are on every horror recommendation list), they will not be included on this one, though they are still iconic and must-watch classics!<br></br><div align="center" ><a class="gradient"><img src="the-grudge.png" alt="scary gay"></img></a></div>Hajime Satô's 1965 Toei movie Kaidan semushi otoko goes by several names in the West: The Ghost of the Hunchback, House of Terrors, and Satan's Pit. Regardless, they are all the same film. The black-and-white picture is considered a lost gem as the Japanese version with Japanese on-screen text intact has yet to be released on home video. However, it has infrequently aired on television. There is also a mostly yet rare faithful Italian dub.

    The Ghost of the Hunchback is an eldritch movie about guests congregating at a recently departed man's isolated estate. In failing to heed ominous warnings from the film's namesake, the party is stalked by a disturbing presence haunting the premises.<br></br><div  align="center"><a class="call"><div style="position:relative;">    Zdraov est pozvonite</div><img src="one-missed-call.png"></a></div>Loosely based on the story of the same name (which means "scarecrow") by famous horror mangaka Junji Itô, Kakashi follows a woman in search of her missing brother. After receiving a letter sent from someone in a remote, bucolic village, the main character goes there in hopes of finding her sibling. Instead, she stumbles upon the locals preparing for a strange local festival involving the veneration of scarecrows.

    As much as a movie like this doesn't follow logic or feels inclined to ever explain itself, the uncanny ambiance is undeniable.<a align="center" class="end">Let us start</a></div></div>
