      This story about young girl named Hatsune. She was born in 1995 near small city Tokuharu. <br></br><div style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Noto Sans Mono', 'Arial', sans-serif; color: rgb(212, 212, 212);"><img src="img/Fashion-School-Outfit-Japanese-Teen-Girls-JK-Uniforms-Cosplay-School-Girl-Clothes-Gray-Shirt-Pleated-Skirt.jpg_Q90.jpg_.jpg" class="img1" style="width: 40%; margin-bottom: 5px;"> Hatsune in middle school</div><br></br> From her childhood she was dreaming about living in a big city but parents had no money on this. Every day Hatsune learned physics for her dream. <br></br> Our heroine got it. On her birthday she goes to university of big city... <div align="center" class="end"><br></br>But it is not a dream...<br></br></div> On Hatsune`s first day she was beaten by her new "friend". Her name Miku. Young and suppressed, Hatsune ran away for few days. For everyone its was a childplay.<br></br>Miku continued her tirrany but Hatsune was accustomed to... or not... After year Miku`s corpse was found. It got no violence trase. This is not a suicede for sure. Her pale body towerd on Tokyo. On her sad dead face was trace of tears.<br></br>Police was thinking that killer is Hatsune. But they was wrong. Hatsune`s life is hell but she was always kind even with Miku. She never 
      wanted evil. <br></br> After a week corpse of Hatsune was found near the sea. It seemed thath she was crawling to it. Her beautyful pale face has a smile. Kindest smile I ever know... <br></br><img src="img/192.jpg" class="img1"></img>
      <br></br>I know who killed them all. Its Hukashi Namuyaki - a vengance spirit of old man. First thing he kills abuser. Usually, Hukashi dosent even touch a victim. Only way it can hurt her, it positive emoutional link with an abuser. Hatsune dosen`t like Miku but she actually dosen`t hate her. We can check it by her diary. Maybe the could be friends... <br></br><img style="width: 50%;" src="img/ol.jpg" class="img1"></img> </div></div>
